By default, every time a :ref:`Types | dice` is evaluated, it is rerolled. However, this often isn't
desired. To prevent this from happening, you can freeze the results via the freeze operator (``!``).
What this will do is recurse through the object, and essentially apply a :ref:`Expressions | roll`
expression on each :ref:`Types | dice` that it finds.
